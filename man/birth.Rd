\description{
BIRTH CALCULATES SEEDLING AND SPROUT BIRTH BASED ON
   SPECIES FECUNDITY, SEEDBED CONDITIONS, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO BROWSING,
   AND THE DEGREE TO WHICH LIGHT, SOIL MOISTURE, AND DEGREE DAYS ARE
   LESS THAN OPTIMUM FOR GROWTH. SOIL MOISTURE AND DEGREE DAY
   MULTIPLIERS ARE SUPPLIED BY SUBROUTINE GMULT.
   A SPECIES CAN HAVE SPROUTS IF AT LEAST ONE
   TREE WITH DIAMETER BETWEEN SPRTMN AND SPRTMX DIED LAST
   YEAR (KSPRT INCREMENTED BY 1 IN KILL).
   RANDOM NUMBERS USED TO DETERMINE OCCURENCE OF BROWSING, NUMBERS
   OF SEEDLINGS AND SPROUTS, AND DBH SUPPLIED BY rand.
