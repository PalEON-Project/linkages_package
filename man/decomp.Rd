\description{
DECOMP CALCULATES CARBON AND NITROGEN FLOWS THROUGH
   SOIL. AVAILABLE N (AVAILN) IS USED IN GMULT TO CALCULATE
   SOIL NITROGEN GROWTH MULTIPLIERS. AET IS FED IN FROM MOIST.
   THIS YEAR'S LEAF, TWIG, ROOT, AND WOOD LITTER IS FED IN FROM KILL
   (ARRAY TYL). THE SIMULATION STARTS ON BARE GROUND (ONLY HUMUS
   PRESENT. BASESC AND BASESN ARE STARTING HUMUS WEIGHT AND N
   CONTENTS READ IN INPUT). THREE TYPES OF SOIL ORGANIC MATTER ARE
   RECOGNIZED: COHORTS EITHER IMMOBILIZING OR RAPIDLY MINERALIZING
   NITROGEN AND A HOMOGENOUS HUMUS POOL SLOWLY MINERALIZING N.
